Hey Martine,

The IDs and Class names are a bit of a mess, I was planning on fixing them up later. Please change them if you find that they are not proper, I am still a little confused on when to use an ID and Class. This may make the JQuery unusable, but you can remove it from the code for now and I can plug it back in later. Email me with any questions and I will try to respond as fast as I can.

Sorry again about not being able to make it to the meeting.

Matthew
